# 👾 89Tain — Code, Creativity, & Controlled Chaos  

### **Hello World**
  
I'm **Titani Manda**, a dynamic fusion of curiosity, creativity, and caffeine-fueled problem-solving. Whether I’m coding scripts that turn ideas into reality, painting lights like I’m channeling Van Gogh on a tech bender, or crafting captions that hit harder than gym day squats—I'm always striving to bring a touch of magic to everything I do. Am hungry!  
After Keyra left, My love is Dart python. Now I make moves with the cursor.

If you’re searching for someone who can write poetic Instagram captions by day and Python by night, welcome. You’ve found Dart profile.

### 🔥 **Core Vibes**  
- 🐾 **Pawprint Energy**: Obsessed with growth, resilience, and lighting up dark spaces with positivity (literaly-yes my house lamps).  
- 🎨 **DIY Enthusiast**: Whether it’s building wooden furniture or making questionable art decisions (yes, I painted my lights), I’m here for the ride.  
- 💡 **Innovator**: Why repeat boring tasks when I can write a script that does it for me? Efficiency is the game, Python is the weapon. Also dart. Pow Pow!!🔫
- 🎧 **Playlist Architect**: My Spotify Wrapped screams versatility—Hov, Kids See Ghosts, K Dot—music fuels everything I do. June’s my birthday month, so no DNA test is needed to confirm my taste.  
- ✍️ **Caption King**: Writing lines so good, they deserve a standing ovation.
